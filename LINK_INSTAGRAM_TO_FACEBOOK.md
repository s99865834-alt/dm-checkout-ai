# How to Link Instagram Business Account to Facebook Page

## Problem
You're seeing "You don't have any Instagram accounts" during OAuth, even though you have an Instagram Business account.

## Solution
Your Instagram Business account must be linked to a Facebook Page. Here's how to do it:

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Option 1: Link via Instagram App (Recommended)

1. **Open Instagram App** on your phone
2. **Go to your Instagram Business Profile**
3. **Tap the menu icon** (three horizontal lines) in the top right
4. **Tap "Settings"**
5. **Tap "Account"**
6. **Tap "Linked Accounts"** or **"Page"**
7. **Tap "Facebook"**
8. **Select or create a Facebook Page** to link to
   - If you don't have a Facebook Page, you'll need to create one first
9. **Confirm the link**

### Option 2: Link via Facebook Page Settings

1. **Go to Facebook.com** and log in
2. **Navigate to your Facebook Page** (or create one if you don't have one)
3. **Go to Page Settings**
4. **Click "Instagram"** in the left sidebar
5. **Click "Connect Account"**
6. **Enter your Instagram Business account credentials**
7. **Confirm the connection**

### Option 3: Link via Meta Business Suite

1. **Go to business.facebook.com**
2. **Select your Business Account** (or create one)
3. **Go to "Accounts" → "Instagram Accounts"**
4. **Click "Add" or "Connect"**
5. **Enter your Instagram Business account credentials**
6. **Select the Facebook Page** to link it to
7. **Confirm the connection**

## Verify the Link

After linking, verify it worked:

1. **Go to your Facebook Page**
2. **Check Page Settings → Instagram**
3. You should see your Instagram Business account listed

## Important Notes

- **You must have a Facebook Page** - Instagram Business accounts cannot be accessed via API without a linked Facebook Page
- **The Instagram account must be a Business or Creator account** - Personal accounts cannot be linked
- **You must be an admin** of both the Facebook Page and Instagram account
- **It may take a few minutes** for the link to propagate through Meta's systems

## After Linking

Once linked, try the OAuth flow again:
1. Go back to your Shopify app
2. Click "Connect Instagram Business Account"
3. You should now see your Instagram Business account in the list

## Troubleshooting

### Still not showing up?
- Wait 5-10 minutes for Meta's systems to sync
- Make sure you're using the same Facebook account that owns the Page
- Verify the Instagram account is actually a Business account (not Personal)
- Check that you're an admin of both the Page and Instagram account

### Need to create a Facebook Page?
1. Go to facebook.com/pages/create
2. Choose "Business or Brand"
3. Fill in your business details
4. Complete the setup
5. Then link your Instagram account using the steps above
