# Setting Up Instagram Professional Account

## Why You Need a Professional Account

The Instagram Business API (which our app uses) **only works with Professional accounts**. Personal accounts cannot be accessed via the API.

## Steps to Switch to Professional Account

1. **Open Instagram App** (or go to instagram.com)
2. **Go to your Profile**
3. **Tap the menu icon** (three horizontal lines) in the top right
4. **Tap "Settings"**
5. **Tap "Account"**
6. **Tap "Switch to Professional Account"** (or "Account type" → "Switch to Professional Account")
7. **Choose your category** (Business or Creator - both work for our app)
   - **Business** is recommended if you're selling products
   - **Creator** works too if you're an influencer/content creator
8. **Complete the setup** (add contact info, business details if applicable)

## After Switching

Once you've switched to Professional:

1. **Link to Facebook Page** (required for API access):
   - Go to Settings → Account → Linked Accounts (or "Page")
   - Link to a Facebook Page
   - If you don't have a Facebook Page, create one at facebook.com/pages/create

2. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for Meta's systems to sync

3. **Try the OAuth flow again** in your Shopify app

## Business vs Creator Account

Both work with the Instagram Business API, but:
- **Business Account**: Better for selling products, has shopping features, analytics focused on sales
- **Creator Account**: Better for influencers, has creator-specific analytics and features

For a Shopify app focused on product recommendations and checkout, **Business Account is recommended**.

## Important Notes

- You can switch back to Personal account anytime, but you'll lose API access
- Professional accounts have access to Instagram Insights (analytics)
- Professional accounts can use Instagram Shopping features (if eligible)
- The account must be linked to a Facebook Page for API access
