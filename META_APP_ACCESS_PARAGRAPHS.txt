1. Where can we find the app?

The app is accessible at https://dm-checkout-ai-production.up.railway.app, however this is an embedded Shopify app that cannot be accessed directly via URL. Reviewers must access it through Shopify Admin using the test store credentials provided separately. You can verify the app is accessible by checking the privacy policy at https://dm-checkout-ai-production.up.railway.app/privacy, terms of service at https://dm-checkout-ai-production.up.railway.app/terms, and webhook endpoint at https://dm-checkout-ai-production.up.railway.app/webhooks/meta. All of these URLs are publicly accessible and can be verified using Meta's debugger tool.

2. Provide instructions for accessing the app so we may complete our review.

This is an embedded Shopify app that runs inside Shopify Admin, so reviewers must access it through the Shopify test store. First, log into the Shopify test store Admin at https://dmteststore-2.myshopify.com/admin using the staff account credentials provided separately in this review submission. Once logged in, navigate to Apps → DM Checkout AI, and the app will open in an embedded iframe within Shopify Admin. The key pages for testing are the Home page (/app) which shows the main dashboard with automation controls, the Webhook Demo page (/app/webhook-demo) which is the recommended method for testing Instagram webhook processing, the Instagram Feed page (/app/instagram-feed) for viewing Instagram posts and product mappings, and the Analytics page (/app/analytics) for viewing message analytics. For testing, we recommend using the in-app Webhook Demo page: navigate to Webhook Demo, select either "Comment → DM" to test comment-to-DM automation with product context or "Direct DM" to test DM automation without product context, choose a scenario like Purchase Intent or Product Question, click "Send Test Webhook", and then review the results in Step 2 which shows webhook processing, AI classification, and automation decision, and Step 3 which shows the message logged in the database with AI response preview. Alternatively, reviewers can test with a real Instagram comment by navigating to the Instagram post [INSERT YOUR INSTAGRAM POST URL], leaving a comment with purchase intent like "I want to buy this" or "How much does this cost?", and within a few moments they should receive a private DM from the Instagram business account, which can be verified in the app by going to Webhook Demo → Recent Messages (Database). A third testing method is to use Meta Dashboard Test Webhook by going to Meta App Dashboard → Webhooks → Instagram, finding messages or comments and clicking Test, clicking Send to my server, and then verifying in the app at Webhook Demo → Recent Messages (Database). Regarding Meta APIs and Facebook Login, this app does NOT use Facebook Login. The app uses Instagram Messaging API for sending and receiving DMs, Instagram Comments API via webhooks for receiving comment events, and Meta Graph API for reading Instagram account information and media. The app authenticates users through Shopify OAuth, not Facebook Login. Users connect their Instagram Business account through a separate OAuth flow that grants permissions to their Facebook Page and linked Instagram Business account. The Meta API endpoints used include GET /{ig-business-id}/media to fetch Instagram posts, GET /{ig-business-id} to get Instagram account info, POST /{ig-business-id}/messages to send Instagram DMs, and webhook subscriptions for messages and comments events.

3. If payment or membership is required to access the full functionality of this app, provide access codes or test credentials so we can access and review all features on this app.

The app has three pricing tiers: FREE tier with 25 messages per month and DM automation only, GROWTH tier at $29 per month with 500 messages per month plus comment-to-DM automation and brand voice features, and PRO tier at $99 per month with 50,000 messages per month and all features including follow-up automation. However, no payment codes are required for testing because the provided Shopify test store (dmteststore-2.myshopify.com) has been upgraded to PRO tier in the database, which provides access to all features including comment-to-DM automation which is required for testing the instagram_business_manage_comments permission, follow-up automation, brand voice customization, and all analytics features. Reviewers can test all features without any payment or subscription setup. The app's billing system uses Shopify's recurring charge API, but the test store bypasses this requirement for review purposes, so reviewers have full PRO access already configured and ready to use.

4. If payment is required to download this app, provide 8 - 10 gift codes so we can download it from app stores without payment.

This question is not applicable because this app is a web-based Shopify app, not a mobile app store application. It does not require download or installation from app stores. The app is installed directly from the Shopify App Store where it is free to install, accessed through Shopify Admin as an embedded web application, and no app store codes or gift codes are required. The app is free to install, and paid subscriptions for GROWTH at $29 per month and PRO at $99 per month are optional upgrades for additional features and higher message limits, but the test store already has PRO access configured so reviewers can test all features without any payment.

5. If access to this app or any of its features is limited to users within a specific geographic location or restricted by geo-blocking or geo-fencing, provide instructions for our reviewers to bypass these restrictions.

This app has no geo-blocking, geo-fencing, or geographic restrictions. The app is accessible from anywhere in the world and all features work globally. Users must have a Shopify store which is available globally, an Instagram Business account which is available globally, and a Facebook Page linked to their Instagram Business account which is also available globally. No VPN or location bypassing is required, and reviewers can access and test the app from any location without restrictions. Additionally, since the Meta app is in Development mode, real-time webhooks may not work, so we recommend using the Webhook Demo page for reliable testing, and the test store credentials and Instagram post URL for testing are provided separately in the review submission.
