## 📝 Permission Request Templates

### For `instagram_manage_messages`:

**Use Case:**
"Our app helps merchants respond to inbound Instagram DMs. The app classifies messages and responds only when it is safe and policy-compliant:
- If the DM has enough product context, it can send a product page/checkout link.
- If the DM lacks product context (e.g., 'I want to buy this product'), PRO tier asks a clarifying question ('Which product?'). Non‑PRO sends no automated reply to avoid guessing the wrong product."

**User Benefit:**
"Merchants can respond to customer inquiries instantly, even outside business hours, improving customer satisfaction and increasing sales conversions."

**Screencast:**
[Link to your video]

**Instructions:**
1. Log into the provided Shopify test store Admin → Apps → **SocialRepl.ai**
2. Go to **Webhook Demo** (`/app/webhook-demo`)
3. Select **Direct DM** and send “I want to buy this product”
4. Expected: intent “purchase” with **no product context** → PRO asks clarifying question; non‑PRO sends no response
5. Select **Comment → DM** and send the same scenario
6. Expected: with product context → response may include product link (depending on mapping and confidence)

### For `instagram_manage_comments`:

**Use Case:**
"Our app automatically responds to Instagram comments on posts. When a customer comments with purchase intent, we send them a private DM with a checkout link."

**User Benefit:**
"Merchants can convert Instagram comments into sales by automatically engaging with interested customers."

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Development Mode Limitation**: 
   - Real-time webhooks only work in Live mode
   - For review, use the test webhook functionality to demonstrate
   - Explain this limitation in your submission

2. **User-Initiated Conversations**:
   - ✅ Your app only responds (doesn't initiate)
   - ✅ Complies with Meta's policy

3. **24-Hour Messaging Window**:
   - ✅ Your app respects the 24-hour window
   - ✅ Only sends automated replies within the window

4. **Data Privacy**:
   - Ensure you explain how you store and use Instagram message data
   - Comply with GDPR/CCPA if applicable

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Create Screencast**: Record demo using Webhook Demo page
