## 2. YouTube video script/outline

Create one 2–3 minute demo video for the landing page and App Store; optionally a longer “setup” video.

### Video 1: Turn Instagram DMs into sales (2–3 min)

- **Goal:** Show outcome (DM → reply with link → sale) and that setup is simple.
- **Script outline:**
  1. **Hook (0:00–0:15):** “You get DMs asking for prices or links every day. What if every one got a checkout link in seconds?”
  2. **Problem (0:15–0:30):** Manual replies are slow; you miss the 24-hour window or forget to follow up.
  3. **Solution (0:30–0:45):** DM Checkout AI connects Instagram to Shopify and sends AI-generated replies with one-click checkout links.
  4. **Demo (0:45–2:00):** Screen recording: open app → show connected Instagram → show product mapping → trigger a test DM (or use existing) → show automated reply with link in app and in Instagram.
  5. **Result (2:00–2:20):** “Track clicks and revenue from Instagram in one place. Free tier: 25 messages a month.”
  6. **CTA (2:20–2:35):** “Install from the Shopify App Store. Link in the description.”
- **Captions:** Add English captions for accessibility and SEO.
- **Publish:** Embed on landing page and link in App Store listing; upload to YouTube and use title/description with target keywords.

### Video 2 (optional): DM Checkout AI setup in 5 minutes

- **Goal:** Reduce setup friction for new installs.
- **Outline:** Connect Instagram → map one product → enable automation → send a test DM → show reply. Keep under 5 minutes with clear steps and captions.
