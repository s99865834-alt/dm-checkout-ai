# App Store Listing & ASO (App Store Optimization)

Use this copy and checklist when submitting or updating the DM Checkout AI listing on the Shopify App Store. Optimize before spending on paid promotion so every click converts.

---

## 1. Title & subtitle

**App name (title):** Keep short; include one high-intent keyword.

- **Option A:** `DM Checkout AI` (brand + category)
- **Option B:** `DM Checkout AI – Instagram to Sales` (add outcome)

**Subtitle (if supported):** One line with keywords for search and ad relevance.

- **Suggested:** `Transform Instagram DMs and comments into sales with AI checkout links`

**Keywords to naturally include in title/subtitle:** Instagram DM, Instagram checkout, DM to sale, Instagram automation, Instagram to Shopify.

---

## 2. Short description (lead with outcome)

Use for the main visible description; lead with the outcome, then features.

**Lead (first 1–2 sentences):**

> Transform Instagram DMs and comments into sales. DM Checkout AI sends AI-powered automated replies with one-click checkout links so you never miss a DM sale.

**Bullets (outcome-focused):**

- Connect your Instagram Business account and map products to posts
- AI replies to DMs and comments with personalized checkout links
- Track clicks and revenue from Instagram in one dashboard
- Free tier: 25 automated messages/month—no credit card required

## 3. Full description (for listing page)

Transform Instagram DMs and comments into sales with AI-powered automated responses and checkout links.

**How it works**

1. Connect your Instagram Business account to your Shopify store.
2. Map your products to Instagram posts so the app knows which product to link.
3. When someone DMs or comments (e.g. “How much is this?”), the app sends a personalized reply with a direct checkout link.
4. Track messages sent, click-through rates, and revenue attributed to Instagram.

## 4. Screenshot captions (5–8 images, in order)

Create 5–8 screenshots that tell the story in this order. Add short captions on each image.

| Order | What to show | Suggested caption |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Home/dashboard with “Connect Instagram” or connected account | Connect your Instagram Business account in one click |
| 2 | Instagram Feed with product mapping UI | Map products to your Instagram posts |
| 3 | Example: “Map Product” modal or list of mappings | Link each post to the right product for instant checkout |
| 4 | Automation controls (DM on/off, comment on/off) | Turn on DM and comment automation |
| 5 | Example automated reply with checkout link (in app or mock) | One-click checkout links in every reply |
| 6 | Analytics: messages sent, CTR, top phrases | See messages sent, clicks, and top trigger phrases |
| 7 | (Optional) Revenue or attribution view | Track revenue from Instagram DMs |
| 8 | (Optional) Brand voice or settings | Set your brand voice—Friendly, Expert, or Casual |

**Tip:** The first 2–3 screenshots drive most decisions. Make sure image 1 clearly shows “Instagram” and “connect” or “connected”; image 2–3 show the mapping and the value (checkout link).

---

## 5. Icon specs

- **Size:** 1200×1200 px (Shopify requirement).
- **Style:** Recognizable at small size (e.g. in search results and category grids). Use simple shapes and clear contrast.
- **Consistency:** Match any external creatives (ads, landing page) so the brand is consistent.

---

## 6. Pricing clarity (in listing and screenshots)

- **Free tier:** Prominent—“Start free: 25 automated messages per month.”
- **Growth:** $29/month—call out “100 messages, comment-to-DM, brand voice.”
- **Pro:** $99/month—call out “Unlimited messages, follow-ups, revenue attribution, priority support.”

Ensure the pricing section in the App Store and any in-app billing screens clearly differentiate what each tier includes so merchants know before installing.

---

## 7. Interactive demo (if available)

- **Goal:** “Try before you install”—show connect → map product → see automated reply with link.
- **Length:** Under 2–3 minutes with clear callouts.
- **Impact:** Can lift conversion ~20–40% when available.
