# Shopify App Store Ads – Keywords & Campaign Setup

Use this doc to set up and manage paid campaigns in the Shopify Partner Dashboard (**Apps > App ads**). Start with Search ads, then add Category and Homepage once you have data.

---

## 1. Where to create ads

- **Partner Dashboard:** [Apps](https://partners.shopify.com) → your app → **App ads**.
- **Eligibility:** New apps may receive **$100 USD ad credit**; use it for your first campaigns.
- **Pricing:** Cost-per-click (CPC); minimum **$5.00/day** per campaign (USD).
- **Placement:** Desktop only (Shopify App Store ads do not show on mobile).

---

## 2. Search ads (primary channel)

Search ads show above organic results when merchants search in the App Store. Start here.

### 2.1 Keywords to bid on

**High intent (start with these; 5–10 keywords):**

| Keyword | Notes |
|--------|--------|
| Instagram DM | Core use case |
| Instagram checkout | Direct intent |
| Instagram sales | Outcome-focused |
| DM automation | Automation intent |
| Instagram to Shopify | Integration intent |
| comment to DM | Feature-specific |
| Instagram shopping app | Category |
| Instagram DM app | Direct |
| sell on Instagram DMs | Long-tail intent |
| Instagram message automation | Automation |

**Broader (add only if CPA stays acceptable):**

| Keyword | Notes |
|--------|--------|
| Instagram | High volume, likely higher CPA |
| social selling | Broader |
| Instagram business | Business segment |

### 2.2 Search campaign settings

- **Daily budget:** Start **$15–20/day** (minimum $5). Increase only when cost-per-install and trial→paid are within target.
- **Bid:** Start at or just above the minimum; raise only for keywords that drive installs or paid plans.
- **Geo:** Start **US, Canada, UK, Australia** (English, Shopify-heavy). Expand by performance.
- **Device:** Desktop (only option for App Store ads).

### 2.3 Suggested Week 1 setup

- **Campaign type:** Search.
- **Keywords:** Add the 5–10 high-intent keywords above; use phrase or exact match if available to reduce waste.
- **Daily budget:** $15–20.
- **Geo:** US, CA, UK, AU.
- **Goal:** Measure installs (Partner Dashboard) and, if possible, trial→paid. Pause or lower bid on keywords that don’t convert after ~1–2 weeks.

## 3. Category ads

Category ads show on App Store category/subcategory pages (e.g. Marketing, Sales). Good for discovery.

### 3.1 Where to run

- **Categories:** Choose the category/categories where DM Checkout AI is listed (e.g. **Marketing**, **Sales**). You can only advertise within your app’s category.
- **Daily budget:** Start **$5–10/day** per category; compare cost-per-install to Search.
- **Geo / device:** Same as Search (e.g. US, CA, UK, AU; desktop).

### 3.2 When to add

- **Week 2:** Add Category ads in 1–2 categories while keeping Search running.
- Reallocate budget from Search to Category only if Category CPA is better.

---

## 4. Homepage ads

Homepage ads show on the App Store homepage. Highest visibility, usually higher CPC.

### 4.1 Settings

- **Daily budget:** Test with **$5–10/day** initially.
- **Geo / device:** Same as above.

### 4.2 When to add

- **Week 3:** Add Homepage only if Search + Category CPA are acceptable. Compare installs and cost-per-install; reallocate from worst-performing placement if needed.

---

## 5. Campaign sequence summary

| Week | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Search ads only. 5–10 high-intent keywords. $15–20/day. US, CA, UK, AU. |
| 2 | Add Category ads (1–2 categories). Keep Search. Small Category budget ($5–10/day). |
| 3 | Optionally add Homepage ($5–10/day). Reallocate from worst-performing placement. |
| Ongoing | Pause underperforming keywords/placements. Double down on keywords that drive installs and paid plans. |

---

## 6. What you cannot change after creation

Once an ad is created, you **cannot** change:

- The app.
- The ad placement (Search vs Category vs Homepage).
- Merchant plan targeting (if used; Shopify Plus feature).

You **can** edit at any time:

- Daily budget.
- CPC bid.
- Geo targeting.
- Device targeting.
- Keywords (for Search ads).

---

## 7. External paid (Meta, Google) – after baseline

Use only when you have:

- A **landing page** (e.g. dmcheckoutai.com) with a clear CTA to the Shopify App Store.
- **Tracking:** UTM parameters (e.g. `utm_source=facebook`, `utm_medium=cpc`) or pixel + “Install” CTA.

**Meta (Facebook/Instagram):**

- **Audience:** Shopify merchants, ecommerce owners, “Instagram for business.”
- **Creative:** Short video showing DM → automated reply → checkout link.
- **Retargeting:** Site visitors and video viewers.

**Google:**

- **Search:** “Instagram DM app,” “Instagram checkout Shopify.”
- **Discovery / YouTube:** Awareness if budget allows.

**Attribution:** Use one CTA to the App Store listing (or landing page that deep-links). Compare cost-per-install and cost-per-paid to App Store ads before scaling external spend.
