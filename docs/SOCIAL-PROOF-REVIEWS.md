# Social Proof & Review Request Process

Getting 10–20 solid reviews early improves conversion and helps ranking. Aim for 4.5+ stars and respond to every review.

## 1. When to ask for a review

Ask **after a clear value moment**, not right after install. Examples:

- **First attributed order:** Customer clicked the DM checkout link and completed a purchase.
- **First week of automation:** They’ve received at least a few automated replies and seen it work.
- **First upgrade:** They moved from Free to Growth or Pro (they already see value).

Avoid asking:
- Immediately after install (no experience yet).
- After an error or support ticket (wait until the issue is resolved and they’re happy).

## 2. How to ask (in-app / email)

Keep it short and make it easy to say yes.

### Option A: In-app message (e.g. Support or Home)

After you detect a value moment (e.g. first order attributed, or 7 days active), show a one-time prompt or banner:

**Example:**

> You just got your first sale from an Instagram DM. If you have a minute, a review on the Shopify App Store really helps us—and other merchants. [Leave a review]

(Link to your app’s Shopify App Store review page. Shopify typically provides this in Partner Dashboard or the app listing URL.)

### Option B: Email (if you collect email or have a way to contact)

**Subject:** Quick favor? (takes 1 min)

**Body:**

> Hi [Name],
>
> I saw you got your first order from Instagram this week—that’s great.
>
> If you have 60 seconds, could you leave a quick review on the Shopify App Store? It helps other stores find us and helps us know what to improve.
>
> [Leave a review]
>
> Thanks,
> [Your name]

### Option C: Support follow-up

When you close a support ticket and the merchant is satisfied:

> Glad we could fix that. If you’re happy with the app, we’d really appreciate a review on the App Store—it helps a lot. [Link]

## 3. What you need from Shopify

- **Review link:** In Partner Dashboard, find the link that takes merchants directly to the “Write a review” flow for your app (or the app listing page where they can click “Reviews” and then “Write a review”). Use this link in all requests.
- **Review notifications:** Ensure you’re notified of new reviews (Partner Dashboard or email) so you can respond quickly.

## 4. Responding to reviews

- **Positive:** Thank them and mention one specific thing they said (e.g. “Glad the checkout links are saving you time.”). Keep it short.
- **Negative:** Thank them, apologize for the issue, and offer to fix it offline: “We’re sorry you ran into this. Please reach out to us at [support email] and we’ll get it sorted.” Then fix the issue and (optionally) ask if they’d consider updating their review.
- **Respond to every review** so merchants and Shopify see you’re active.

## 5. Goals

- **Weeks 1–4:** Get 10–20 reviews.
- **Ongoing:** Maintain 4.5+ average; respond within 24–48 hours when possible.
- **No incentives:** Do not offer payment or rewards for reviews; Shopify and platform policies prohibit this. Asking after a genuine value moment is enough.
