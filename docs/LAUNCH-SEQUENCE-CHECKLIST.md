# Launch Sequence Checklist

Use this checklist to execute the promotion plan in order. Do not skip the foundation steps before spending on ads.

---

## Pre-launch (before approval / listing live)

- [ ] **Listing copy:** Finalize title, subtitle, short and full description using [APP-STORE-LISTING-ASO.md](APP-STORE-LISTING-ASO.md).
- [ ] **Screenshots:** Create 5–8 screenshots with captions (connect → map → automation → reply → analytics).
- [ ] **Icon:** 1200×1200, readable at small size.
- [ ] **Pricing:** Free / Growth / Pro clearly shown in listing and in-app.
- [ ] **Landing page:** Deploy marketing index page with headline, features, CTA, optional email capture (see app root `/`).
- [ ] **Demo video:** Record one 2–3 minute video (connect → map → reply); embed on landing page and use in listing if supported.
- [ ] **App Store URL:** Set `SHOPIFY_APP_STORE_URL` (or update the CTA href in the landing route) to your live listing URL once approved.

---

## Week 0 (listing live, soft launch)

- [ ] Install the app on 1–2 test stores (your own or friendly merchants).
- [ ] Fix any store-submission or post-approval bugs.
- [ ] Collect first 3–5 reviews (ask after first value moment; see [SOCIAL-PROOF-REVIEWS.md](SOCIAL-PROOF-REVIEWS.md)).
- [ ] Confirm Partner Dashboard shows installs and (if applicable) billing events.

---

## Week 1 (turn on paid + organic)

- [ ] **Shopify App Store ads:** Create Search campaign with 5–10 high-intent keywords from [ADS-CAMPAIGN-SETUP.md](ADS-CAMPAIGN-SETUP.md). Budget $15–25/day. Geo: US, CA, UK, AU.
- [ ] **Content:** Publish first blog post (e.g. “How to sell on Instagram DMs”) and first YouTube video (“Turn Instagram DMs into sales”) per [CONTENT-SEO-PLAN.md](CONTENT-SEO-PLAN.md).
- [ ] **Community:** Post in 2–3 places (Shopify Community, Facebook group, Reddit) with helpful advice; mention the app only when relevant and within rules.
- [ ] **Reviews:** Ask 2–3 more happy users for a review after value moment.

---

## Week 2–4 (optimize)

- [ ] **Ads:** Add Category ads (1–2 categories). Keep Search. Review keyword performance; pause or lower bid on non-converters.
- [ ] **Ads:** If CPA is acceptable, add Homepage ads with small budget ($5–10/day). Reallocate from worst placement if needed.
- [ ] **Product Hunt:** Prepare and launch (tagline, gallery, 1–2 min video). Rally early users to upvote and comment.
- [ ] **Content:** Publish 2nd and 3rd blog posts (comment-to-checkout, best Instagram automation).
- [ ] **Reviews:** Reach 10–20 total reviews; respond to every new review.
- [ ] **Metrics:** Review installs, ad spend, cost per install, trial→paid weekly (see [METRICS-TRACKING.md](METRICS-TRACKING.md)).

---

## Month 2+ (scale)

- [ ] **Ads:** Scale budget on winning keywords and placements only. Cap daily spend until LTV:CAC is clear.
- [ ] **External paid:** If you have landing page + UTM tracking and App Store ads are profitable or close, test Meta or Google with small budget.
- [ ] **Content:** 1–2 posts per month; repurpose into short social clips with link to app.
- [ ] **Partnerships:** Reach out to Instagram/social tool creators, Shopify experts, or agencies for affiliate/referral or co-marketing.
- [ ] **Trending:** Continue driving consistent installs and external traffic to support “Trending” eligibility on the App Store.
